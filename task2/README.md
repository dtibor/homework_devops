Task 2 - Infrastructure as code
Objective
:
You get a Node.js application from the Engineering team and your task is to deploy that application to the Cloud (AWS, Azure or GCP) in a scalable fashion.
For this exercise, you may choose any non-trivial Node.js application that implements a REST API.
For example:
https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-nodejs
Task:
You can use any Cloud technology/service to create a scalable deployment: please explain why you chose that technology!
Your infrastructure should be defined as code
Briefly explain how to deploy and update your infrastructure (in your Readme)
Assume that your Node.js application is stateless, it does not need a database or similar to store data. But your application might perform complex calculations or other longer operations.
Assume that your application will get a few million HTTP requests every day, but the exact load shape is unpredictable, there might be usage spikes during peak hours
Try to optimize for overall cost and maintainability
